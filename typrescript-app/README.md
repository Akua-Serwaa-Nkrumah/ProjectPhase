##My Todolist APP

This app is a simple todolist app that keeps track of pending or active tasks. It also keeps track of completed tasks. Tasks can be created, viewed, edited and deleted. The status(pending or completed) of a task can be updated by dragging and dropping from active to completed and vice versa. 

1. To edit tasks, use the edit icon by clicking, editing and hitting enter.
2. To move between completed and pending tasks, simply drag and drop.
3. To delete a task simply use the delete icon.
4. To mark as completed, simply click the check(âœ”) icon.
   Have fun with the app.
